# Porth

It's like Forth but in Python. But I don't actually know since I never programmed in Forth, I only heard that it's some sort of stack-based programming language. Porth is also stack-based programming language. Which makes it just like Forth am I rite?

**WARNING! This language is work in progress!**

## Quick Start

```console
$ ./porth.py sim ./examples/test.porth
$ ./porth.py com ./examples/test.porth
$ ./output
```
