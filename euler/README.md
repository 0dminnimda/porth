# Project Euler Problems

This folder contains some [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems we solved in Porth. It is strongly recommended to use [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/) when running the solutions in [Simulation Mode](https://github.com/tsoding/porth/blob/c15888ae3d37f85f5f0ff8734f58c1e64ba77d30/README.md#simulation) since CPython is too slow for that. (Some solutions may take >10 minutes to execute when using CPython)

**The solutions are presented only for the language demonstration purpose! Don't look into them until you have solved the corresponding problems! Don't spoil the pleasure of solving the problems yourself!**
